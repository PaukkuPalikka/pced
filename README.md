# pced: Placeholder C EDitor
Currently a very small terminal text editor written in C, using ncurses as the terminal driver. It works decently, there are no serious bugs anymore but the interface is still a bit weird.

# Usage and keybindings
* open a file: pced \<filename\>
* save the file: F1
* exit: Escape (please note that this will discard any changes not saved with F1)
* moving around in text: arrow keys
* inserting text: type text
* deleting text: backspace
